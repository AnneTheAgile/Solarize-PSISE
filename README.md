# Solarized-PSISE
## What is it?
Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. You can read more about it [here](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). 

This is a port of the Solarized color scheme to the PowerShell ISE.
